<p>Hi, I’m Ellie! I’m a writer, researcher, and creative soul who loves exploring the world through words, art, and storytelling. I’m passionate about making meaningful work, whether I’m crafting professional writing, diving into academic projects, or experimenting with creative, multimodal pieces.</p>
<p>I love finding new ways to express ideas — mixing text, visuals, and design to tell stories that connect with people. I care deeply about clarity, inclusivity, and helping others engage with ideas in ways that feel genuine and approachable.</p>
<p>When I’m not working or studying, you’ll probably find me exploring creative projects, journaling, or finding inspiration in the little things around me. This website is my space to share the work I’m proud of and the things I care about most, and I hope it gives you a little glimpse into who I am.</p>
